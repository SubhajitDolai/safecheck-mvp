### 2. Streamlit Frontend (Port 8501)

- **Status**: ✅ Running
- **URL**: http://localhost:8501
- **Interface**: Interactive web demo

### 3. Machine Learning Models

- ✅ Email phishing detection (60%+ accuracy)
- ✅ Audio spoof detection (pre-trained models loaded)
- ✅ Multi-channel risk fusion

## 🧪 Tested Features

### Email Detection ✅

```
Test 1: "Your account is locked. Click here to verify: fake-login.com"
→ Result: 61% phishing probability ✅ PHISHING

Test 2: "Meeting at 3pm today. Please confirm your attendance."
→ Result: 44% phishing probability ✅ LEGITIMATE

Test 3: "URGENT: Your UPI account is suspended! Verify immediately..."
→ Result: 57% phishing probability ✅ PHISHING
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Open: http://localhost:8501
2. Try the "Check Email" section with sample phishing emails
3. Upload audio files from `data/audio/` folder
4. Test combined risk assessment

### Option 2: API Direct Testing

```bash
# Test email endpoint
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/check_email" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your account is locked. Click here: fake-site.com"}'

# Test health endpoint
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Option 3: Quick Test Script

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python quick_test.py
```

3. **Show Combined Risk (30 seconds)**
   - Demonstrate multi-channel fraud scoring
   - Show risk level recommendations

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start backend (Terminal 1)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start frontend (Terminal 2)
streamlit run app/frontend.py

# Run tests
python test_api.py
python quick_test.py
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Port 8000 in use?**

```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Virtual environment issues?**

```bash
deactivate
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Missing dependencies?**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
